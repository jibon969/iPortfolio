                            I have over 3 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small
                            startups
                            and
                            large organizations.
                            While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend
                            services
                            (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).

                            I love music, dance, reading book, hacking and playing cricket.
                            I contribute to open source projects at leisure.
                            I would love to pursue challenging opportunities which contribute to a better tomorrow for

                            I love all things Python.

                            I have mostly worked as a backend developer during my career over the past 1-2 years.
                            But I have had my share of front end development too.
                            I am definitely <span class="font-weight-bold">not</span> a kickass front end ninja but I do

                            I know <span class="font-weight-bold">git</span> and work on

                            I am also a big fan of <span class="font-weight-bold">Docker</span> and find it a painless
                            solution
                            to develop and deploy my applications.
                            I have working experience with <span class="font-weight-bold">MySQL</span>,

                            <span class="font-weight-bold">SQLs</span> as well.
                            I will not only <span class="font-weight-bold">build</span> your app but also
                            <span class="font-weight-bold">deploy</span> it to cloud providers like heroku, Digital

                            or
                            any VPS.
                            I am a believer in <span class="font-weight-bold">code quality</span> and follow the best
                            practices.
                            I use <span class="font-weight-bold">Jetbrains IDEs</span> for optimum productivity and
                            cleaner
                            codes.
                            I believe every developer should write <span class="font-weight-bold">unit tests</span>
                            before starting to write business logic. BDD and <span class="font-weight-bold">TDD</span>

                            new tools to solve challenging problems. I have decent expertise in these tools too:

                            I have written several command line tools in the language.
                            Cross compilation and the go fmt tool is a big plus for me.
