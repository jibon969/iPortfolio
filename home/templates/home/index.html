                        I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small startups
                        and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in
                        building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).

                        I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
                        I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking
                        for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership
                        responsibilites, and gain experience with architecture and project management.
